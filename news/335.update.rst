Removed the ``certifi`` run-time hook because it was not required for ``certifi`` to function in a frozen application. It was sometimes setting the ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` environment variable which causes applications to behave differently when frozen. In particular the ``SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()`` method loads the certificates from ``certifi`` when the ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` environment variable is set.
